import numpy as np

# Follow the tasks below to practice basic Python concepts.
# Write your code in between the dashed lines.
# Don't import additional packages. Numpy suffices.

# Task 1: 
# Instructions:
#Write a function that takes one numeric argument as input. 
#If the number is larger than zero, the function should return 1, otherwise is should return -1.
#The name of the function should be step

# Your code here:
# -----------------------------------------------

def step(num):
    return 1 if num > 0 else -1

# -----------------------------------------------


# Task 2:
# Instructions:
#Write a function that takes in two arguments: a numpy array, and an integer (call argument "cutoff" and set default to 0).
#The function should return a numpy array of the same length, with all elements smaller than the cutoff being set to cutoff).
#The name of the function should be ReLu


# Your code here:
# -----------------------------------------------

def ReLU(arr, cutoff = 0):
    below_cutoff = arr < cutoff
    arr[below_cutoff] = cutoff
    return arr

# -----------------------------------------------


# Task 3:
# Instructions:
#Write a function that takes in a two-dimensional numpy array of size (n, p) and a one-dimensional numpy array of size p.
#The function should start by multiplying the two numpy arrays (matrix multiplication).
#Next, apply the ReLu function from above to the resulting matrix and return the result.
#Name the function neural_net_layer

# Your code here:
# -----------------------------------------------

def neural_net_layer(twoD_arr, oneD_arr, cutoff = 0):
    mult_arr = np.dot(twoD_arr, oneD_arr)
    relu_arr = ReLU(mult_arr, cutoff = cutoff)
    return relu_arr
